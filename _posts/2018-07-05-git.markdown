summary: A class I have given on Git a few times to economists
---

In the summer of 2012, I gave two non-technical git classes to groups of economits at the IMF and I have since given the class at the OECD.

Though originally designed as a code management system, git has a use far beyond the computer science world. For economists (and researchers in general), using git for your research projects can save you a lot of time and headache, as it tracks the development history of your project, all the while making it easy to share. Basically, if you've ever been in the situation where you copy a directory to try out "a new idea", you need git. If you have ever been in doubt where the "correct" version of your project is, you need git. If you have ever worked on a project with a coauthor, you need git! Hopefully, the pdfs linked to below will help you learn it, as the documentation online can be rather (unnecessarily) technical. Now, please note, that there may be some typos in these pdfs as I made them in a very short period of time. I hope to revist them at some point and update them, so keep an eye on the date at the top :)
